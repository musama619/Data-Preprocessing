# Data Preprocessing <br>

* ### Handling Missing Data <br>
* ### Encoding Independent Variables <br>
    *OneHotEncoder* <br>
* ### Encoding Dependent Variable <br>
    *LabelEncoder* <br>
* ### Train - Test Split <br>
* ### Feature Scaling <br>
    *Standardisation*
    
## Note: 
#### 1. Standardisation :  values between -3 and 3 (works all the time)
####  2. Normalisation : values between 0 and 1 (recommended only when features follows normal distribution)

- remember to apply feature scaling after train test split
- feature scaling does not need to be applied on dummy variables as they already have values between -3 and 3
